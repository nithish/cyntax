# cyntax package
C language plugin for atom editor.

Have lots of functions in your C program? 
Cyntax helps you to save time and continue flow of typing.

Gcc compilers throw warnings if method is not defined before its declaration. 
It makes a programmer a professional programmer if coding standards are followed but following coding standards takes time and hampers the flow of programming(typing out the code). Cyntax is aimed at maintaing the flow while maintaining codind standards.

Currently, Cyntax allows to add method definitions from method declarations directly, without having to scroll all the way to the top and adding the entry. Thus, saving time and maintaining the flow.

Other features coming soon!
