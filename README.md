# cyntax package
C language plugin for atom editor.

It makes a programmer a professional programmer if coding standards are followed but following coding standards takes time and hampers the flow of programming(typing out the code). Cyntax is aimed at maintaing the flow while maintaining codind standards.

Currently, Cyntax allows to add method definitions from method declarations directly, without having to scroll all the way to the top and adding the entry. Thus, saving time and maintaining the flow.

All you have to do is to add a comment like this => <h3><b>"//Method_Definitions"</b></h3> in the place where you need your method definitions to be placed.
Select the text to be added and press <kbd class="platform-windows platform-linux">Ctrl+Shift+o</kbd> or right click and click the option <b>Cyntax Add</b>

Other features coming soon!
